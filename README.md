## Tasks
* Task 1.2
    - For Task 1.2, I was tasked with choosing the data structure for my Recipe App.
        - I will personally be using a List structure since I want this to be mutable. While being quick to view and load would be beneficial, being able to more freely edit the lists and structures would be more ideal.
        


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8.7
